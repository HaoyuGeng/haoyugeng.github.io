I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [School of Statistics and Data Science at Nankai University](https://stat.nankai.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Changliang Zou](http://web.stat.nankai.edu.cn/chlzou/).  
I received my B.S. and Ph.D. in Statistics from Nankai University in 2020 and 2025, respectively. My PhD advisors are Professors [Changliang Zou](http://web.stat.nankai.edu.cn/chlzou/) and [Zhaojun Wang](http://web.stat.nankai.edu.cn/zjwang/).
My research interest includes: High Dimensional Inference; Multiple Hypothesis Testing; Change Point Detection.
